                I'm a mental health counselor who believes in getting to know you and your
                interests first, then the healing can begin. I provide counseling services to teens and adults via
                telehealth in Washington state. I believe being fun and interest-oriented helps clients 
                find where they are presently, so we can build a desireable future. 
                I firmly believe people never fail, plans fail, so let's make a new plan. You
                are the expert of your own life; I'm here to help you remember the strengths that may
                have been forgotten along the way or maybe needs some adjustement to the present. 
                I know finding the right someone to support you on your journey can be hard; I'm
                honored to assist in your life adventure in any way I can.

                I have been trained in a variety of theoretical approaches and integrates these
                approaches to best fit clients' needs. I enjoy working from a trauma-informed, geek therapy lens to gain
                a holistic view that can highlight strengths and orient us to best build additional supports. 
                I integrate aspects from resiliency-centered counseling, narrative therapy,
                drama therapy, and geek therapy.
